# Movie Web App üé¨

## About project üìö
Movie Web App is a web-based application focused on learning how to work with APIs. This app allows users to fetch movie data from an external API, display information about popular movies, and save favorite movies. By utilizing the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/), the app offers a simple and efficient way to browse, search, and store favorite movies.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **ReactJS (Vite)**: Used to build a fast and responsive user interface with ReactJS, leveraging Vite as the bundler for quicker development.
- **Async Programming**: Data fetching is done asynchronously using `async/await` to keep the app responsive while making API requests.
- **React Router**: Enables smooth navigation between pages within the app, allowing users to switch views without reloading the page.
- **State Management**: Manages application state using React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` to ensure data is kept organized and up-to-date throughout the app.
- **API Integration**: Fetches movie data using the [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed using Vercel.

## Learning Focus üìò
- Displaying popular movie data fetched directly from the API.
- Building a movie search feature that allows users to search for movies by title.
- Using state management to store users' favorite movies, making it easy to access them later.
- Storing favorite movies in the browser's **local storage** so that the data persists even after a page refresh or returning to the site later.
